    ISSUES

* Output message ordering does not guarantee that messages are processed in same order.
That is not unless receiving server is explicitly crafted to handle messages this way. Any standard server may
receive/process messages in different threads or handlers which would require tricky synchronization.
If one wants to ensure output messages ordering then they should be given serial numbers or sort messages again
on receiving side. In latter case there is no point in sorting them inside this proxy at all.

* Using HTTP GET for data update is abuse of HTTP. In particular it won't communicate well through proxies.
One should change method to POST, PUT or UPDATE whichever is appropriate.

* Current logic does not handle well case when client stops sending messages or just makes long pause.
In that case last messages in reordering queue will not be sent.

* Decide what to do when sending message to destination fails (retry or discard)

* Extract testing facilities into separate module. These bring unnecessary code and dependencies into resulting JAR.

* Detect buffer overflow situation
